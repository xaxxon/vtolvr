Intro mission for 1-2 players

Finish the end of your F22 ferry flight.   You're way low on fuel because the first tanker for some reason didn't show up.  

Also there's a lot of jamming and such going on.   No one knows why.

Both F22s show up really low on fuel but the -2 has a little more so -1 can refuel first.

A couple low tech fighters show up but a large fleet is on the way to force the player to run to the given airfield.

When landed the hangar doors open up and enemy marines open fire killing you - turns out you were tricked into landing at enemy controlled airspace.

Mission should be quick and easy - it's just for story purposes and to get you flying an f22.
