SlamJam Mission 3
Mission for 1-6

TODO:
need to create and fix up all the different jammer location settings for sending gps points and doing random spawns.   Setting GV for which spawns vs which ones are found needs to be updated

We found where the GPS jammers are - they're in a nearby island and we need to take them out.   

We have A-10s and F-16s situated in a local air base but with limited armorment. 

We have a pair of F22s we can launch with the precision penetrator bombs needed to hit the underground GPS Jammers once identified

Enemy has fighters on the island but doesn't have supplies to fly them.   They're rushing in supplies from nearby islands via cargo ships.   Fighters will take off if cargo ships arrive.   There are also destroyers in the viscinity if the cargo ships need escorts.
