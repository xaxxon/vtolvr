# Mission 1:
### Title: <TBD>
Goal: Plot introduction and familiarization with F22

Starts with tanking - low fuel state and 1 or 2 F22s.   Optionally some F16s.   All planes must refuel.   
Then they're sent to an airfield.   Something seems a bit off but they land.   If there are f16s the base turns hostile and shoots the everliving crap out of them as soon as the F22s are landed.   Marines appear outside the F22 and kill the pilots.



# Mission 2:
### Title: The Heist


# Mission 3:
### Title: Payback
We've located the general viscinity of the GPS spoofers that were used to hijack out F22s.   We need to find the exact locations and destroy enemy defenses.   Then the F22s will strike the 4(?) special hardened targets with their "special penetrator bombs".   A10s will mark targets (probably with laser or whatever mission editor allows) and the "speicial targets" are marked as invulnerable until the mission progresses and alt spawns for the F22s are created with bomb loadout.   Before then F22 may be available for CAP.   F16s are available as well.   F22 will land and swap to another alt spawn that has different weapons available and another life will be provided to allow the respawn to the alt if needed.   

If single player no enemy fighters will spawn or maybe some attack planes will for the A10 to shoot down.   2x A10, 2xF22, 2xF16.  No F22s can be lost.   A10s and F16s can respawn.
